      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research focuses on developing robust, reusable software infrastructure for modern genomics and data-intensive life 
        science. I have worked at the intersection of research software engineering, genome annotation and bioinformatics workflows,
        building tools that make complex analyses reproducible, maintainable and easier for others to use.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        A recurring theme is turning fragile, one-off pipelines into sustainable platforms: modular workflows, containerisation, 
        automated testing and clear documentation, developed in close collaboration with domain scientists. This improves the 
        reliability of downstream biological insights and reduces the cost of keeping tools alive as methods and datasets evolve.

          "This involved comparing genome assembly and annotation quality of several automated tools " +
          "against a \"gold-standard\" set of helminth reference genomes curated using manual means (e.g. genome browsers). " +
          "The aim was to demonstrate the continued need to invest in platforms that facilitate manual annotation, by " +
          "highlighting instances where automated methods consistently under-performed. In particular, I focused on exonic " +
          "differences between orthologues of a set of closely related schistosome species, where high conservation would be " +
          "expected. The results have mostly been written up in a draft paper which I hope to submit in the not-too-distant future."

          "for visualising evidence of alternative splicing. From the outset, we recognised that existing methods for " +
          "displaying transcriptomic evidence (e.g. RNA-seq coverage tracks) don't clearly indicate where alternative transcripts might exist. " +
          "We developed two complementary workflows, both implemented for compatability with the genome browser JBrowse 2: a plugin " +
          "for rendering additional BED-format fields to indicate cell-type (colour) and strength of support (opacity) at splice " +
          "junction sites; and a custom tag for aligned reads in BAM files to indicate \"most likely\" alternative transcript that they " +
          "support, allowing reads to be sorted/coloured in JBrowse 2 using existing functionality to visually group supporting evidence. " +

          "users of Artemis - a no longer supported genome browser - to encourage their migration to the new platform. Currently in " +

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Research Impact</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      A central impact of my work is the development of research software that lowers the barrier to high-quality genomic analysis 
      and is reused across multiple projects, groups and domains.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Tools that I have contributed to and continue to maintain include <a href="https://github.com/sii-companion/companion"
      target="_blank"><em>Companion</em></a>, an automated annotation platform
      that delivers high-quality structural and functional annotations within hours. <em>Companion</em> combines reference-guided
      annotation with visualisation tools, and is accessible both as a <a href="https://companion.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> public
      web server</a> and a maintained <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/uofgiii/companion" target="_blank">Docker image</a>. Since
      launch, it has been adopted by over 1,000 researchers worldwide, who have used it to annotate over 10,000 genomes across
      parasitology, crop science, and ecology (See <a href="/papers/1">Papers</a>).      
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Another tool, <a href="https://github.com/haessar/peaks2utr" target="_blank"><em>peaks2utr</em></a>, is a Python CLI for 
      annotating 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of mRNAs, which I developed from scratch. These regions regulate key mRNA-based
      processes such as localisation, stability and translation, making them
      important targets for functional inference. Since publication, <em>peaks2utr</em> has been downloaded thousands of times and has
      attracted a growing number of citations.
